Clarifications and recommendations
1. The program uses secondary memory as far as possible. It will use some of the main memory in things like filling the tableview as it is impossible to display the information without resorting to it.
2. A file must always be uploaded to the program. The players that are added and the modifications made in the program will affect the csv that was loaded at that moment.
3. The searches are carried out by a range of attributes, so they use a different search method than the one that would be used for single-attribute searches, which is obviously faster. To use this last search method, the same attribute must be entered in both boxes.
